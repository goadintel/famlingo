## 🚦 Usage Limit Enforcement

### How It Works:

**Step 1: Track Usage**
- Every pronunciation API call is tracked automatically
- Stored by family ID and month (YYYY-MM format)
- Costs calculated per request

**Step 2: Check Limits**
- Before each API call, check if user has quota remaining
- Free tier: 100/month limit
- Premium/Family: Unlimited

**Step 3: Show Warnings**
- At 80 pronunciations (80%): Yellow warning banner
- At 100 pronunciations (100%): Red block banner
- User cannot proceed without upgrading

**Step 4: Upgrade Prompt**
- User clicks "Upgrade Now"
- Modal shows all 3 tiers with features
- User selects tier
- (Payment integration needed - currently demo mode)
- Subscription upgraded immediately
- User can continue with unlimited access

## 💡 Optimization Strategies

### To Increase Conversions

1. **Timing:**
   - Show upgrade prompt at 80% (not 100%)
   - Offer 7-day free trial
   - Launch promo: 50% off first month

2. **Messaging:**
   - Emphasize "unlimited" not "100 limit"
   - Show value: "$0.10 per pronunciation vs $2.99 unlimited"
   - Social proof: "Join 500+ premium learners"

3. **A/B Testing:**
   - Test different price points ($1.99 vs $2.99 vs $4.99)
   - Test different free tier limits (50 vs 100 vs 150)
   - Test different upgrade prompt designs

4. **Features:**
   - Add Premium-only phrases
   - Add voice selection (male/female) for Premium
   - Add progress sync for Premium
   - Add family leaderboard for Family plan

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **No Payment Integration**
   - Upgrade is demo mode only
   - Need Stripe/PayPal integration
   - Need backend payment API

2. **localStorage Only**
   - Data doesn't sync across devices
   - Lost if browser cache cleared
   - No user accounts/authentication

3. **No Email Notifications**
   - No welcome emails
   - No payment confirmations
   - No usage alerts

4. **Manual Admin Password**
   - Hardcoded in code
   - No forgot password flow
   - No multiple admin users

### For Production

⚠️ Add Stripe payment integration
⚠️ Migrate to MongoDB/PostgreSQL
⚠️ Implement user authentication
⚠️ Add email service (SendGrid)
⚠️ Set up error tracking (Sentry)
⚠️ Add uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
⚠️ Implement proper admin auth (JWT)
