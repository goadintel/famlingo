# FamLingo Development - Resume Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

## Current State:
Voice recording toggle feature has been **fully implemented and built**, but **not yet deployed** due to SSH connection issues with the Alibaba Cloud server.

## What Was Completed:

### Voice Recording Toggle Implementation ✅
- **File Modified**: `/home/cmantra/famlingo/src/views/PracticeView.vue`
- **Change**: Converted from hold-to-record pattern to click-toggle pattern
- **Reason**: User reported hold-to-record got stuck in loops, especially with microphone permission dialogs

### UI Changes (lines 114-158):
- Changed events from `@mousedown/@mouseup/@touchstart/@touchend` to simple `@click="handleRecordingToggle"`
- Updated button text: "Press & Hold to Record" → "Click to Record"
- Recording state: "Release to stop" → "Click to Stop"
- Added clear visual states with color coding:
  - **Purple gradient**: Ready to start (initial state)
  - **Red with pulsing animation**: Currently recording
  - **Green**: Recording complete and ready
  - **Gray**: Disabled during AI analysis

### JavaScript Changes (lines 536-554):
```javascript
async function handleRecordingToggle() {
  if (voiceRecording.isRecording.value) {
    voiceRecording.stopRecording()
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300))
    if (voiceRecording.hasRecording.value && voiceRecording.audioBlob.value) {
      await analyzeVoicePronunciation()
    }
  } else {
    voiceRecording.resetRecording()
    await voiceRecording.startRecording()
  }
}
```

### Build Status: ✅ Completed successfully
- Production files ready in `dist/` folder
- Build output: 268.09 kB JS, 38.13 kB CSS

## Pending Task:

### Deployment Blocked ❌
- SSH connection to server (139.224.49.63) is being immediately closed
- Error: `Connection closed by 139.224.49.63 port 22`
- Root cause: Likely Alibaba Cloud platform issue (user not receiving verification codes for login)
- **Action needed**: Wait for Alibaba Cloud platform issue to resolve, then access console to restart SSH service

### Deployment Command (when ready):
```bash
rsync -avz --delete dist/ root@139.224.49.63:/var/www/famlingo
```

## Files Modified This Session:
1. `/home/cmantra/famlingo/src/composables/useVoiceRecording.js` - Added `toggleRecording()` function
2. `/home/cmantra/famlingo/src/views/PracticeView.vue` - Updated UI and event handlers for toggle pattern

## Next Steps:
1. Resolve Alibaba Cloud platform/SSH access issue
2. Deploy the built files to production
3. Test the new toggle recording feature on mobile device

## Technical Details:

### Voice Recording Composable Update
Added to `/home/cmantra/famlingo/src/composables/useVoiceRecording.js`:
- New `toggleRecording()` function that starts recording if stopped, stops if recording
- Exported in return object alongside existing methods

### Benefits of Toggle Pattern:
✅ **Clearer state** - No confusion about whether you're holding or not
✅ **Better permission handling** - Click-once doesn't interfere with mic permission dialog
✅ **Mobile-friendly** - No issues with touch events or accidental releases
✅ **Visual clarity** - Red = recording, Green = ready, Purple = start new

**Note**: The feature is code-complete and tested locally - just needs server access to deploy.
