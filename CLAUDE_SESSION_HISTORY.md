# Claude Code Session History - FamLingo Project

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12
**Purpose:** Preserve context and decisions for building a commercially successful family language learning app for the China market

---

## 🎯 PROJECT VISION

**FamLingo (家语)** - Family-focused language learning app targeting Chinese families learning English and expat families learning Chinese.

### Core Innovation: BILINGUAL UI AS PEDAGOGY

**Every element of the UI is simultaneously in Chinese AND English.**

This isn't just accessibility - it's a learning strategy:
- Buttons: "Start Practice / 开始练习"
- Labels: "Current Streak / 当前连续"
- Messages: "Great job! / 干得好！"
- Navigation: "Dashboard / 仪表盘"

**Why this matters:**
- **Passive learning** - Users absorb vocabulary during every interaction
- **Context reinforcement** - See words used in real situations, not just flashcards
- **No language barriers** - Chinese families AND expat families feel at home
- **Immersive environment** - The entire app is a bilingual learning space
- **Natural acquisition** - Learn how both languages structure information

### Why FamLingo Will Win in China

1. **Family accountability** - Built-in motivation through competition and shared progress
2. **Bilingual by design** - UI itself is a teaching tool, not just content
3. **Local-first architecture** - No servers, no data concerns, works offline, truly private
4. **China-accessible AI** - DeepSeek integration for pronunciation, translation, personalized learning
5. **WeChat ecosystem native** - Meet users where they already are
6. **Self-contained & sellable** - One-time family license, no ongoing costs
7. **Practical daily use** - 5-10 min sessions that fit busy schedules

**Target: Be the 0.1% that actually succeeds in China market!**

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Stack
- **Vue 3 + Composition API** - Modern, reactive, performant
- **Vite** - Lightning fast dev experience, optimized builds
- **Pinia** - State management for multi-user data
- **TailwindCSS** - Rapid UI development, consistent design
- **IndexedDB** - Large local storage capacity (vs localStorage limits)
- **GitHub API** - Cross-device sync (like Monster Fitness pattern)
- **DeepSeek AI API** - Pronunciation scoring, translation verification, AI tutor

### Key Design Principles
1. **Bilingual by default** - EVERY text element shows both languages simultaneously
2. **Local-first** - All data stored locally, sync is enhancement not requirement
3. **Offline-capable** - Full functionality without internet
4. **Fast & lightweight** - Target <1MB initial bundle
5. **Mobile-first** - Optimize for foldable phones (Chinese market reality)
6. **Zero backend** - Static site deployment, no server maintenance

---

## 🌐 BILINGUAL UI IMPLEMENTATION

### Design Pattern
Every text element uses this structure:

```vue
<template>
  <button class="btn">
    <span class="en">Start Practice</span>
    <span class="cn">开始练习</span>
  </button>
</template>

<style>
.btn {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 2px;
}
.en { font-size: 1rem; }
.cn { font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.9; }
</style>
```

### Typography Considerations
- **Font stack**: System fonts that support both Latin and CJK characters
- **Size hierarchy**: English slightly larger (easier to read at small sizes)
- **Line spacing**: Extra leading for Chinese characters (more complex shapes)
- **Weight**: Regular for English, slightly bolder for Chinese (better legibility)

### Layout Strategy
- **Vertical stacking** for short text (buttons, labels)
- **Inline with separator** for longer text ("Your score: 8/10 / 你的分数：8/10")
- **Responsive** - Switch to single language on very small screens (user preference)

### Reusable Components
```vue
// BilingualText.vue
<template>
  <div :class="['bilingual', orientation]">
    <span class="en">{{ en }}</span>
    <span class="sep" v-if="orientation === 'inline'"> / </span>
    <span class="cn">{{ cn }}</span>
  </div>
</template>

// Usage:
<BilingualText en="Hello" cn="你好" orientation="vertical" />
```

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 MULTI-USER SYSTEM

### User Management
- **Up to 10 users per family** - Practical limit for household + extended family
- **Simple profile creation** - Name (bilingual), avatar, age group, learning direction
- **No authentication** - Trust-based (family context), no passwords
- **Quick user switching** - Dropdown or avatar selection
- **Individual progress tracking** - Completely separate data per user

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  family: {
    id: "uuid",
    name: { en: "The Chen Family", cn: "陈家" },
    created: "2025-10-12",
    users: [
      {
        id: "user1",
        name: { en: "Xiaoming", cn: "小明" },
        avatar: "👦",
        ageGroup: "child", // child, teen, adult
        learningDirection: "cn-to-en", // cn-to-en or en-to-cn
        level: "beginner",
        stats: {
          totalSessions: 45,
          totalPhrases: 234,
          currentStreak: 12,
          longestStreak: 23,
          accuracy: 0.87
        },
        progress: {
          // Spaced repetition data per phrase
          "phrase_001": {
            interval: 7,
            easeFactor: 2.5,
            dueDate: "2025-10-15",
            correctCount: 8,
            incorrectCount: 1
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    settings: {
      syncEnabled: true,
      githubToken: "...",
      githubRepo: "..."
    }
  },
  sharedLibrary: {
    phrases: [ ... ]
  }
}
```

## 🔄 BIDIRECTIONAL LEARNING

### Mode Toggle
Users can practice in either direction:

**Chinese → English (Recognition)**
- Show: 你好
- User responds: "Hello" (typing or voice)
- Good for: Beginners, passive vocab building, reading comprehension

**English → Chinese (Production)**
- Show: Hello
- User responds: "你好" (pinyin input or characters)
- Good for: Intermediate+, active recall, speaking/writing skills

### Why Both Directions Matter
- **Recognition ≠ Production** - Can understand but not speak is common plateau
- **Balanced fluency** - Need both for real conversation
- **Motivational variety** - Switch modes to keep practice fresh
- **Track separately** - Accuracy in each direction reveals learning gaps

### Implementation
- Store learning direction preference per user
- Allow toggling mid-session for flexibility
- Track accuracy separately by direction
- AI feedback adapts to direction (pronunciation vs tone/character accuracy)

Response: {
  score: 8.5/10,
  feedback: {
    en: "Tone on '好' is good, '你' needs higher pitch",
    cn: "'好'的声调很好，'你'需要更高的音调"
  },
  suggestion: "Try 'nǐ' with rising tone ↗ / 试试'nǐ'用上扬的声调 ↗"
}
```

#### 2. Translation Verification
```javascript
// User types "How are you?" for "你好吗?"
Response: {
  correct: true,
  alternatives: [
    { en: "How's it going?", cn: "怎么样？" },
    { en: "How are you doing?", cn: "你过得怎么样？" }
  ],
  naturalness: 0.9
}
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Bilingual State Management (Pinia)
```javascript
// stores/language.js
export const useLanguageStore = defineStore('language', {
  state: () => ({
    uiLanguagePrimary: 'en', // User can set preference
    showBothLanguages: true, // Always true for FamLingo
    currentUserDirection: 'cn-to-en' // Learning direction
  }),
  getters: {
    getText: (state) => (key) => {
      // Return both languages always
      return {
        en: translations.en[key],
        cn: translations.cn[key]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### GitHub Sync Pattern (Monster Fitness Proven)
```javascript
// On app load:
1. Load local data from IndexedDB
2. Check if GitHub sync is configured
3. Fetch remote data from GitHub
4. Merge remote + local (deduplication)
5. Save merged data to IndexedDB
6. Auto-commit changes after each session

// Sync file: famlingo-family-data.json
{
  version: "1.0",
  family: { name: { en: "...", cn: "..." }, ... },
  users: [ ... ],
  phrases: [ ... ],
  lastSync: "2025-10-12T08:30:00Z"
}
```

### Offline-First Architecture
```
User Action → Pinia Store → IndexedDB (immediate) → GitHub (background)
                                  ↓
                              UI Update (instant, bilingual)
```
