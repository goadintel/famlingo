# Screen Lock Fix - Listen Mode Audio Issue

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ
Audio playback in Listen Mode was stopping when the mobile device screen locked after timeout, even though the app continued running in the background.

## Root Cause
The **Web Speech Synthesis API** (`window.speechSynthesis.speak()`) stops working when the screen locks on mobile devices. This is a browser security/power-saving feature.

## Solution Implemented
Added the **Screen Wake Lock API** to keep the screen on while Listen Mode is active, preventing the screen from locking during audio playback.

## What Changed

### Code Changes
**File**: `src/views/ListenView.vue`

1. **Added wake lock variable**:
   ```javascript
   let wakeLock = null
   ```

2. **Request wake lock on play/resume**:
   ```javascript
   async function startListening() {
     isPlaying.value = true
     await requestWakeLock()  // ‚Üê New
     await playCurrentPhrase()
   }
   ```

3. **Release wake lock on pause/stop**:
   ```javascript
   function pauseListening() {
     isPlaying.value = false
     releaseWakeLock()  // ‚Üê New
   }
   ```

4. **Added wake lock functions**:
   - `requestWakeLock()` - Acquires screen wake lock
   - `releaseWakeLock()` - Releases screen wake lock
   - Event listeners for wake lock release

5. **Added visual indicator**:
   - Green badge showing "Screen lock disabled - listening mode active"
   - Only visible when audio is playing

### User Experience Improvements
- ‚úÖ Screen stays on during Listen Mode
- ‚úÖ Audio continues playing without interruption
- ‚úÖ Visual confirmation that wake lock is active
- ‚úÖ Automatic lock release when paused/stopped
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers

---

## Browser Support

### Works On ‚úÖ
- **Chrome Mobile** (Android): Full support
- **Edge Mobile** (Android): Full support
- **Safari iOS** (16.4+): Full support
- **Chrome Desktop**: Full support (but not needed)

### Fallback ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Safari Desktop**: Not supported (graceful degradation)
- **Firefox**: Limited support (graceful degradation)
- **Older browsers**: Falls back to normal behavior

## How to Test

### Mobile Testing
1. Open https://famlingo-api.com on your mobile device
2. Navigate to Listen Mode
3. Start playing audio
4. Wait for screen timeout (30-60 seconds)
5. ‚úÖ Screen should stay on
6. ‚úÖ Audio should continue playing
7. ‚úÖ Green "Screen lock disabled" notice should show

### What to Verify
- [ ] Screen doesn't lock while audio plays
- [ ] Green notice appears when playing
- [ ] Wake lock releases when paused
- [ ] Wake lock re-acquires when resumed
- [ ] Console shows wake lock messages

### Console Messages
When debugging, check console for:
```
‚úÖ Wake Lock acquired - screen will stay on
‚ö†Ô∏è Wake Lock released
üîì Wake Lock released manually
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Works
The Screen Wake Lock API:
- Prevents screen from auto-locking
- Keeps display on (but can dim)
- Minimal battery impact
- Purpose-built for media playback

### Security
- Requires HTTPS (‚úÖ already using)
- No permission prompt needed
- User can manually lock device
- Auto-releases on tab switch

### Battery Considerations
- Screen stays on = more battery drain
- Wake lock releases immediately on pause
- User can manually lock screen to override
- Minimal CPU overhead
